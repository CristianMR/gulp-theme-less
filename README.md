gulp-theme-less
===============

A LESS plugin for Gulp. Clean LESS files, to make easy themes.

## What clean?

Cleans properties, selectors, and mixins with static content. So if a variable is present, content will dynamic.

## Make easy themes

Easy and clean. You don't need to worry about all the static content. A theme only needs the properties that need be changed.

## Install

```
npm install gulp-theme-less
```

## Usage

> gulpThemeLess(options)

```javascript
'use strict';

var gulp = require('gulp');
var gulpThemeLess = require('gulp-theme-less');

gulp.task('theme-less', function(){
    return gulp.src('./app/styles/main-style.less')
        .pipe(gulpThemeLess({excludeLessFiles: ['variables.less'],
            removeExcludeLessFiles: true}))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./app/styles/themes/'));
});
```

## Options

There are some options, by default:

```javascript
var defaults = {
    importLessFiles: true,
    excludeLessFiles: [],
    removeExcludeLessFiles: true
};
```

### importLessFiles

Adds the import LESS files to the content.

> gulpThemeLess({importLessFiles: boolean})

**Example**:

Before

> variables file

```less
    @primaryColor: #eeeeee;
```

> Main file

```less
    /* Import variables */
    @import "all/the/path/to/variables.less";

    .style {
        color: @primaryColor;
    }
```

> Script

```javascript
    gulp.task('theme-less', function(){
        return gulp.src('./app/styles/main-style.less')
            .pipe(gulpThemeLess({excludeLessFiles: ['all/the/path/to/variables.less']}))
            .pipe(gulp.dest('./app/styles/themes/'));
    });
```

After

> Main File

```less
    /* Import variables */
    @primaryColor: #eeeeee;

    .style {
        color: @primaryColor;
    }
```

### excludeLessFiles

Don't adds the file content. By default the import sentence don't stay in the file.

> gulpThemeLess({excludeLessFiles: array})

**Example**:

Before

```less
    /* Import variables */
    @import "all/the/path/to/variables.less";

    .style {
        color: @primaryColor;
    }
```

> Script

```javascript
    gulp.task('theme-less', function(){
        return gulp.src('./app/styles/main-style.less')
            .pipe(gulpThemeLess({excludeLessFiles: ['all/the/path/to/variables.less']}))
            .pipe(gulp.dest('./app/styles/themes/'));
    });
```

After

```less
    /* Import variables */


    .style {
        color: @primaryColor;
    }
```

### removeExcludeLessFiles

If it's false, the import sentence stay in the file.
